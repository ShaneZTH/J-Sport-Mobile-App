## 2. App Description
J-Sport helps users to avoid the awkwardness of not having enough players for sports they love by allowing users to find people nearby to form a game. Not only could users form games via J-Sport, but the small-group game setting also builds stronger bonds between the people than large events of hundreds of people. Beyond the sports, users could also share their thoughts and discuss sports via J-Sport.
